# Overview

The [Health and Science](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/Actualites/De-la-formation/Ecole-sante-sciences-un-parcours-d-excellence) is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.

# Current Course

   - Introduction to noisy and uncertain models.
   
   - Recalls on function analysis, derivation rules and extrematlity conditions. Basis functions (exponential, logarithm, trigonometric).

   - Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).

   - Case study: The fall of an apple.
