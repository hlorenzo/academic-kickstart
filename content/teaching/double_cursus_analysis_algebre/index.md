# Overview

The [Health and Science](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/Actualites/De-la-formation/Ecole-sante-sciences-un-parcours-d-excellence) is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.

# Course

   - Physical problem example: two weights bound with a spring. System of two bounded ordinary differntial equations (**EDO**). Solution with no linear algebra general theory.
   
   - Linear algebra discovering: vectors, matrices, basis operations: sum, product, trace, determinant, inverse. Notions of *free family*. Diagonalisation.

   - Two applied examples: 

    - Square inverse problem (as much equations as variables): solution with matrix inversion.
    - Solve a system of coupled linear **EDO** thanks to diagonalisation.

# Practical work on Python

  - General formalism over Python for vectors and matrices. 
  - How can we do the *loops* ?
  - Square linear problem resolution.
  - Eigen-space decomposition.
  - Numerical solution of the problem: two weights bound with a spring.
