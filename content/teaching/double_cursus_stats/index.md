# Overview

The [Health and Science](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/Actualites/De-la-formation/Ecole-sante-sciences-un-parcours-d-excellence) is established since 2107 and proposes to the students of second year medical studies, pharmacology and odontology an early formation to research.

# Course

   - Introduction to statistical language and notions such as *event*, *incompatibility* or *independancy*.
   
   - Enumerations and Bayes formula

   - Classical estimators (*mean*, *variance*)

   - Usual discret and continuous laws.
   
   - An introduction to the statistical tests.
